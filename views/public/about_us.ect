  <h3>What is Skwibl:</h3>

  <p>
    Skwibl is a common space for designers and clients to collaborate on a project.
    As a designer you get to enjoy simple project management for your images and videos.
    And, your client can mark specific places on an image or a video frame to simplify your communication.
    All interaction is in real time, which allows you to be literally and figuratively on the same page with your
    client.
